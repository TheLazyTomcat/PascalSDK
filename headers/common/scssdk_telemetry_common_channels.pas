(**
 * @brief Offset from the game_time simulated in the local economy to the
 * game time of the Convoy multiplayer server.
 *
 * The value of this channel can change frequently during the Convoy
 * session. For example when the user enters the desktop, the local
 * economy time stops however the multiplayer time continues to run
 * so the value will start to change.
 *
 * Represented in in-game minutes. Set to 0 when multiplayer is not active.

(**
 * @brief Time until next rest stop.
 *
 * When the fatique simulation is disabled, the behavior of this channel
 * is implementation dependent. The game might provide the value which would
 * apply if it was enabled or provide no value at all.
 *
 * Represented in in-game minutes.
